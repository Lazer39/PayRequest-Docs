# Create Dynamic Payment Links

## What are Dynamic Payment Links?

In our Dashboard, you can create payment links, but with your own personal payment page, you can create payment requests without creating, just via a custom URL.

Save time with creating payment links, just use dynamic links like: payrequest.me/name/12,50 or even payrequest.me/12,50/title/email

### Examples Dynamic Payment Links

* payrequest.me/name/$3,40
* payrequest.me/name/3,40/invoice-3494

Change name with your own username.wer

{% hint style="info" %}
 You can claim your own username in Dashboard -&gt; Settings -&gt; Personal Page
{% endhint %}
